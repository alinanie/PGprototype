<p>Our main goal within this project will be to develop a new way to build a sustainable relationship with an online audience of Millennials (18-35 years old) that only reads the content through social media links, and more specifically through their mobile phones. In this sense, we will focus on creating a solution that will enable De Persgroep to transform their one-time visitors into committed readers.</p>
